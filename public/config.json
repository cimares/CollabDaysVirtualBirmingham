      "description":"Easier, more compelling, and more interactive technology isn’t enough to get your users to use it. You can’t simply build it and expect that they will come. In this session, you’ll learn from neurology and psychology what you can do to encourage people to take the leap into your roll out. We’ll fly over cornfields in Iowa to learn how some farmers took advantage of advances in farming – and some didn’t. \n\nWe’ll dissect our two different brains and realize that our rational consciousness isn’t in as much control as we’d like to believe. We’ll learn from marketing to make our specific calls to action. We’ll explore the impacts of trust on economies and continents. After this session, you’ll have a whole new superhero utility belt of tools for making adoption work in your organization – whatever technology you’re trying to deploy.​",
